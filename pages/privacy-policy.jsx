                <h2><span>2.</span> WHAT DATA DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
                <p className={styles.subtitle}><b>Here we explain in detail what personal data we collect from you, for what purposes we use it,  what technical data is collected automatically when you use the Website, and how we communicate with you.</b></p>
                <p>2.1 <b>Collection of personal data.</b> We comply with data minimization principles. This means that we collect only a minimal amount of personal data that is necessary for your use of the Website. We use your personal data for limited, specified and legitimate purposes explicitly mentioned in this Privacy Policy. For example, we use it only for the purposes of providing you with access to the Website, maintaining and improving the Website, replying to your inquiries, and pursuing our legitimate interests. We do not repurpose your personal data. This means that we do not use it for any purposes that are different from the purposes for which your personal data was provided. Below, you can find an overview of the types of personal data that we collect, the purposes for which we use it, and the legal bases on which we rely when processing it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Inquiries.</b> When you contact us by email or by using the contact form available on the Website, we collect your first name, last name, email address, organization (if applicable), and any information that you decide to include in your message. We use such data to respond to your inquiries and provide you with the requested information. The legal bases on which we rely are ‘pursuing our legitimate interests’ (i.e. to grow and promote The Earth Foundation) and ‘your consent’ (for optional personal data). We will store this data until you stop communicating with us.</li>
                    <li><b>Newsletters.</b> If you decide to subscribe to our newsletter by completing the form available on the Website, we collect your email address. We use it to deliver the requested newsletter and inform you about current and future events and initiatives of The Earth Foundation. The legal basis on which we rely is ‘your consent’. We will store this data until you unsubscribe from our newsletter. You can opt-out from receiving our communications at any time free of charge by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link included in our newsletters or by contacting us directly.</li>
                    <li><b>Surveys.</b> From time to time, we may ask you to complete a survey sent by us. When you complete a newsletter survey, we collect your role or occupation (e.g. student, parent, teacher, mentor, or other), city, and country. When you complete an application survey, we collect your date of birth, academic institution, title of the degree, CV, motivation letter, and any other information that you decide to provide in the survey. The surveys are facilitated by our third-party service providers Typeform and Moosend. We use such data to evaluate the profiles of our candidates, provide you with tailored information about our initiatives, and analyze and improve our activities. The purposes of your personal data collected through surveys will always be specified in the surveys. The legal basis on which we rely is ‘your consent’ (optional). We will store this data until (i) you unsubscribe from our newsletter or (ii) your application is no longer necessary for its purpose.</li>
                    <li><b>Location and cookies.</b> When you browse the Website, we or our third-party analytics service provider (as explained below) collect your location and cookie-related data. We use such information to analyze the technical aspects of your use of the Website, prevent fraud and abuse, and ensure the security of the Website. For more information on our use of cookies, please refer to our <Link href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</Link>. The legal basis on which we rely are <i>‘pursuing our legitimate interests’</i> (i.e. to analyze our content and protect the Website) and <i>‘your consent’</i>. We will store this data as long as analytics records are necessary for our activities or you withdraw your consent.</li>

                <p>2.2 <b>Sensitive data.</b> We do not collect or use any special categories of personal data (“sensitive data”) from you, unless you decide, at your own discretion, to provide such data to us. Sensitive data refers to your health, religious and political beliefs, racial origins, membership of a professional or trade association, or sexual orientation.</p>
                <p>2.3 <b>Refusal to provide personal data.</b> If you refuse to provide us with your personal data when we ask for it, we may not be able to perform the requested operation and you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Website, receive the requested newsletter and information, or get our response. Please contact us immediately if you think that any personal data that we collect is excessive or not necessary for the intended purpose.</p>
                <p>2.4 <b>Collection of non-personal data.</b> When you browse the Website, we may have access to certain technical non-personal data collected from you by our analytics service provider. Such data does not allow us to identify you in any manner. The non-personal data includes the following information: </p>

                <p>2.6 <b>Your feedback.</b> If you contact us, we may keep records of any questions, complaints, recommendations, or compliments made by you and the response.

                <p>2.7 <b>Aggregated and de-identified data.</b> In case your non-personal data is combined with certain elements of your personal data in a way that allows us to identify you, we will handle such aggregated data as personal data. If your personal data is aggregated or de-identified in a way that it can no longer be associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, it will not be considered personal data and we may use it for any legitimate purpose.</p>
                <p>2.8 <b>Important service notices.</b> If we have your email address and it is necessary to do so, we may send you important informational messages, such as technical or administrative emails.
