                      <p>Sir Ranulph Fiennes</p>
                      <p>Described in 1984 as the ‘World’s Greatest Living Explorer’ by the Guinness Book of Records, Sir Ranulph Twisleton-Wykeham Fiennes is the only explorer to be awarded a double clasp Polar Medal by Her Majesty the Queen, acknowledging both his Arctic and Antarctic achievements. At the age of 65, Sir Ranulph became the oldest Briton to conquer Mount Everest, raising more than GBP2.5 million for Marie Curie Cancer Care. His expeditions have raised millions for the Multiple Sclerosis Society, which has enabled the building of Europe’s first MS Research Centre in Cambridge. In 1993 he was awarded an OBE for ‘human endeavor and charitable services’. Sir Ranulph is also the author of several books and holds the current world record as being the only person ever to have climbed Mount Everest and crossed both Antarctica and the Arctic Ocean via the Poles.</p>
