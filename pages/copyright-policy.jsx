                <h2><span>1.</span> YOUR CONTENT</h2>
                <p>By submitting any content to us (other than personal data) like your CV and motivation letter (“Your Content”), you grant us unrestricted, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable rights to use, distribute, advertise, adapt, remix, modify, publicly display, excerpt, prepare derivative works of, and reproduce Your Content for the purposes of carrying out our legitimate interests (e.g., to offer, maintain, and promote the Website).</p>
                <br />
                <p>You agree not to submit Your Content that violates the Terms or any applicable laws, including intellectual property rights of others (copyright, trademarks, and alike) and you agree to pay all royalties, fees, and any other monies applicable to Your Content. You are not allowed to submit us  any content that you have not made or that you are not authorised to use. Also, Your Content should not contain any materials protected by copyright, including music tracks, photos, videos, programmes, and texts, if you do not have the necessary authorisation to use such materials.</p>
                <br />
                <p>You understand and agree that, in order to ensure the security of the Website, we may, but have no obligation to, monitor or review Your Content. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse to upload, modify, delete, or remove Your Content, in whole or in part, that violates these Terms or may harm our reputation. However, you remain solely responsible for Your Content.</p>
                <h2><span>2.</span> OUR CONTENT</h2>
                <p>Most of the content made available by us on the Website (excluding Your Content), is owned by us, our partners, agents, licensors, vendors, and/or other content providers (“<b>Our Content</b>”). Our Content includes, but is not limited to, text, images, audiovisual content, source code, trademarks, service marks, and trade names. Our Content is protected by the applicable intellectual property laws and international treaties. You are not allowed, without obtaining prior written authorisation from us, to copy, distribute, make available, disassemble, make alterations, decompile, reverse engineer, translate, adapt, rent, loan, use, lease or attempt to grant other rights to Our Content to third parties, or use any manual or automated means to scrape any content available on the Website.</p>
                <h2><span>3.</span> THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
                <p>Some of the intellectual property assets, such as Your Content and trademarks, featured on the Website may be owned by you or third parties. Such third-party intellectual property does not belong to us and it remains the sole property of the respective third-party proprietors.</p>
                <h2><span>4.</span> FAIR USE POLICY</h2>
                <p>In the US and other countries, it may be possible to reuse materials protected by copyright without obtaining permission from a copyright holder under certain circumstances (‘fair use’). Such fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis and different rules may apply in different countries. For example, copyright-protected works used for teaching, commentary, criticism, news, or research may fall within the scope of fair use and, therefore, you may not need authorisation to use such works. We strongly recommend consulting a qualified lawyer to seek advice and make prior assessment of your materials that you intend to use under the fair use doctrine. We do not provide advice or assessments regarding Your Content or fair use policies applicable to you.</p>
                <h2><span>5.</span> COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS</h2>
